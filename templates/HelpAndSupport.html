                <div class="faq-answer">
                    To use the Team Builder, start a chat in the main interface and ask for team composition suggestions. You can specify roles, playstyles, or preferences, and our AI will provide recommendations based on player statistics, synergies, and current meta. For example, you can ask for a balanced team with a strong duelist and good map control. The AI will analyze the best possible combinations and explain its choices, helping you understand the team dynamics.

                    You can access individual player statistics or compare players directly in the chat. For instance, you can ask for Player A's statistics on Jett in the last five matches or compare Player A and Player B on their Jett performance, focusing on entry frags and first blood percentage. The assistant will provide insights based on recent data, including breakdowns of aim accuracy, ability usage, economic performance, and more. This feature is particularly useful for team managers and players looking to improve their game.

                    After building a team or specifying an existing lineup, you can request a performance breakdown. You can ask for an analysis of the team's strengths and weaknesses on a specific map or how the team would perform against a composition heavy on controllers. The assistant will provide insights based on player roles, agent abilities, historical performance data, and current meta trends. It will highlight synergies, potential weaknesses, and suggest strategies to maximize the team's effectiveness. This feature is invaluable for pre-game planning and post-match analysis.

                    We are committed to providing the most current and accurate data possible. Our system updates player statistics and performance metrics multiple times daily, pulling from official VALORANT API endpoints and trusted third-party data providers. This ensures that you are working with information that reflects recent matches and tournaments. However, due to API limitations and data processing times, there might be a slight delay in reflecting the very latest matches. For critical decision-making, we recommend cross-referencing with official VALORANT sources. You can always ask the assistant when the data was last updated for the most current information on data freshness.

                <div class="faq-answer">
                    Currently, ValoAssist does not have a built-in feature to permanently save team compositions. However, you can create a unique team code for any composition by asking the assistant to generate a code for the team. The AI will provide a short, memorable code that you can note down. Later, you can recreate the team by saying the team code. This allows you to quickly reference and discuss specific team compositions without the need for a full save feature. We are actively working on implementing a more robust save and share system in upcoming updates.
